# Encrypt
openssl enc -e -des -in infile.txt -out ciphered.txt -k si

# Change letter 'N' by 'x', and save file as ciphered_changed.txt
tr N x < ciphered.txt > ciphered_changed.txt


# Decrypt
openssl enc -d -des -in ciphered.txt -out infile1.txt -k si

You will note some characters change but could be valid words and
the receiver will not notice the change.

So, we will need something more to strengthen our cipher: MAC


# Compute HMAC
openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac si infile.txt
